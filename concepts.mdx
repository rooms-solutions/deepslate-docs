    | Setting | Description |
    |---------|-------------|
    | System prompt | Define the assistant's role and behavior |
    | Greeting | Initial message when answering a call |

    | Call event hooks | Trigger webhooks on call events (e.g., transcript ready) |

Deepslate supports white-label reselling with a multi-tier vendor model. Vendors can set their own pricing and billing through Stripe.
